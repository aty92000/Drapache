Drapache:

A python server that uses the dropbox API to serve files that are hosted on dropbox

It will create an index for a folder if one doesn't exist

It also can execute python scripts identified by files with a .dbpy extension.

There are special functions and objects accessible from inside these python scripts to make a dynamic web app.
Read about these special functions at get.drapache.com/docs.

These special functions are where contributions will be most helpful, they can be found in dbpybuiltins.py
I'm going to nail down what exactly these will have access to, but it is easy enough to make it possible for them
to have a reference to anything.

I'm hosting an instance on heroku, go to get.drapache.com to set it up.

If you want to host an instance locally do the following:

	0. make sure that all the requirements present in requirements.txt are satisfied
		(pip install -r requirements.txt will do it, as should starting a new virtualenv I think)
	1. Go to dropbox.com/developers and create a new app
	2. Fill in the file config.py with the app key and secret of that new app
	3. run `python get_dropbox_oauth.py [TESTING_SUBDOMAIN] >> [SUBDOMAIN_FILE]`
		(where TESTING_SUBDOMAIN is the subdomain you want to add to your local instance,
		and SUBDOMAIN_FILE is the name of the file in which you want to save subdomains)
	4. In config.py, fill in the SUBDOMAIN_FILE variable with the file path from step 3.
	5. Add a line like '127.0.0.1	TESTING_SUBDOMAIN.localhost' to your /etc/hosts file
		(this enables local subdomain routing.. if there is a better way let me know!)
	6. Run `python server.py` and you should have a drapache instance on localhost (the default port is 5501)
	
	Notes:
		- add more testing subdomains by repeating step 3 for other subdomains
		- There are other ways of managing subdomains than a flat file.. look in subdomain_manager.py for the base class
		and an implementation of managing subdomains with mysql
