Things that can be done from here:


- Make more subdomain managers / improve the Mysql one with cacheing.
	• this is important because the subdomain lookup occurs for every request
	
	- redis
	- local in - process cache? due to forking I don't think would help
	- memcache?
	
	
- Add more dbpybuiltins
	
	• Ok.. first I have to provide a clear spec of what is going to be available in that scope
	• if you create a new function, make sure the docstring clearly explains what it does
	• the doc string will eventually be directly mapped to get.drapache.com/docs, so it can include html
	
	important builtins:	
	- render_template_to_string
	- load_file_to_json (or something like)
	- read_file
	- get_url(url,with_params={key:values})?
	
	- open_file_for_writing <--- tricky implementation, I have an idea how to do it in a concurrency-safe way, and it's coming soon
	- load_file_to_json_for_writing (or maybe both json are one function... have to think about this)
