Drapache:

A python server that uses the dropbox API to serve files

It will create an index for a folder if one doesn't exist

Static files work great.

I'm trying to include the ability to execute python scripts that in a dropbox folder, this is where problems come in.

It works, but its very hack-y and unstable



I'm hosting an instance on heroku, go to get.drapache.com to set it up.
